	"content":"Dart is an open-source Web programming language developed by Google. It was unveiled at the GOTO conference in Aarhus, Denmark, October 10–12, 2011.[3] In order to run in mainstream browsers, Dart relies on a source-to-source compiler to JavaScript. According to the project site, Dart was 'designed to be easy to write development tools for, well-suited to modern app development, and capable of high-performance implementations. Dart is a class-based, single-inheritance, object-oriented language with C-style syntax. It supports interfaces, abstract classes, reified generics, and optional typing. Static type annotations do not affect the runtime semantics of the code. Instead, the type annotations can provide documentation for tools like static checkers and dynamic runtime checks."

	"author":"Jeremy Ashkenas",

	"content":"CoffeeScript is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell[1] in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability.[3] Specific additional features include list comprehension and pattern matching"

	"author":"Microsoft Corporation",
	"id":3,
	"content":"It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. Anders Hejlsberg, lead architect of C# and creator of Delphi and Turbo Pascal, has worked on the development of TypeScript. TypeScript supports header files that can contain type information of existing JavaScript libraries, enabling other programs to use objects defined in the header files as if they were strongly typed TypeScript objects. There are third-party header files for popular libraries like jQuery, MongoDB, and D3.js. TypeScript headers for the Node.js basic modules are also available, allowing development of Node.js programs within TypeScript."

	"header":"JavaScript as ECMAScript",
	"author":"Brendan Eich",
	"id":4,
	"content":"It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. JavaScript (at least the strict subset asm.js) is also considered an assembly language of the web – a compile target of source-to-source compilers – for making client side web applications, using other programming languages, supported by all the major browsers without plug-ins. It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications"

	"header":"ActionScript by Macromedia",
	"author":"Gary Grossman",
	"id":5,
	"content":"ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (now dissolved into Adobe Systems). It is a derivation of HyperTalk, the scripting language for HyperCard. It is now a dialect of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), though it originally arose as a sibling, both being influenced by HyperTalk."
